                <li><strong>1856</strong> - Born in the Austrian Empire (present day Croatia)</li>
                <li><strong>1887</strong> - Developed an induction motor that used on
                     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current">alternating current (AC)</a>, a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States because of its advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882)</li>
                <li><strong>1891</strong> - Patented a Tesla coil is a radio frequency oscillator that drives an air-core double-tuned resonant transformer to produce high voltages at low current;</li>
                <li><strong>1894</strong> - Began investiganting radiant energy of "invisible" kinds, later indentified 
                     as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray">"X-Rays"</a></li>     
                <li><strong>1896</strong> - Demonstrated a boat that used a coherer-based radio control—which he dubbed "telautomaton"—to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden.[133] The crowd that witnessed the demonstration made outrageous claims about the workings of the boat, such as magic, telepathy, and being piloted by a trained monkey hidden inside.</li>
